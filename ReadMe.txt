Data2Modler is a gui interface for making simple models using a form like interface. 

In this project I had used **MEAN** stack to build the website and services as well as **fastapi** for machine learning task.

Data2Modler also have the wiki page where one can read about the Machine learning concepts while working creating them using gui interface.

Using this Data2Modler one can perform the following task at very simple level:
- Dataset upload.
- Traget variable selection and features selection.
- Selection on model.
- selection of test and training set size.
- can view Model evaluation
- can download the Model pickel file

For setting up the project simply setup a angular and fast api and you are good to go.
